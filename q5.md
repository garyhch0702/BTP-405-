# Approach 1 (doubleL): Uses a loop to double each number and stores results in a list, which is then iterated over to print each doubled number.

# Approach 2: Utilizes list comprehension for the same purpose, making it more concise but still storing all results in memory before printing.


# Approach 3 (doubleG): Implements a generator function. It yields doubled numbers one at a time, without storing the entire sequence in memory, making it more memory-efficient. This is particularly beneficial for large sequences.

# doubleG(n) is a generator function. It's advantageous because it yields items one at a time, consuming less memory. This is especially beneficial for large datasets, as it doesn't require storing all elements in memory at once like a list would.
